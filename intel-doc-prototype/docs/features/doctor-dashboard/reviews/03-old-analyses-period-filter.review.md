# Review Verdict
- Status: PASS WITH FIXES
- Summary: Structurally complete 17-section feature spec for `Фильтрация старых анализов по периоду` and aligned with the broad IntelDoc guardrails. It is not fully implementation-ready because key behavior remains templated/generic, especially feature-specific state logic, access lifecycle, audit details, and analytics acceptance criteria.

## What is strong
- The artifact type is clear enough for review as a flow step/block and the file follows the canonical section structure.
- The spec identifies result date with upload-date fallback and non-mutating filtering.
- The spec avoids EHR/lab/insurance/scheduling integration assumptions and avoids diagnostic, prescription, or treatment-decision language.

## Critical issues
1. Filter rules and boundary cases are not precise enough
- Severity: Medium
- Where: Sections 7, 10, 11, 12, 13, and 15.
- Problem: The spec does not define available presets/custom range behavior, inclusive date boundaries, fallback labeling, no-result state, or whether filter analytics should capture filter type.
- Why it matters: Date filters are easy to implement inconsistently, especially when result date is missing and upload date fallback is used.
- Recommended fix: Define presets, custom range validation, inclusive boundaries, fallback labels, and no-result behavior.

2. Access lifecycle and audit details are too generic
- Severity: Medium
- Where: Sections 5, 10, 13, 14, and 15.
- Problem: Access control says ownership or approved access is required, but does not define grant source, expiration/revocation, invalid-access behavior per actor, or exact audit event names for sensitive views/mutations.
- Why it matters: IntelDoc requires explicit access control and auditability for patient data; generic language leaves implementation and QA to infer security behavior.
- Recommended fix: Add role-specific access lifecycle rules, revocation/expiration behavior, and explicit audit events with actor, object, surface, and result.

3. Analytics and DoD are present but not sufficiently feature-specific
- Severity: Medium
- Where: Sections 14 and 15.
- Problem: The analytics events use generic viewed/primary_action/blocked patterns, and the DoD does not assert the feature-specific rules that make this spec testable.
- Why it matters: Product success and QA cannot distinguish meaningful actions, error causes, or readiness outcomes if instrumentation remains generic.
- Recommended fix: Add event properties tied to the feature-specific state model and extend DoD with concrete acceptance checks for this feature.

## Missing pieces
- Preset list; inclusive/exclusive boundaries; custom range validation; no-results state; analytics properties for filter_type and result_count.
- Role-specific access lifecycle: grant source, expiration, revocation, and invalid-access outcome.
- Explicit audit event names for sensitive view/create/update actions and blocked access where security review requires it.
- Feature-specific analytics properties beyond generic `primary_action`.
- DoD checks that assert the concrete feature rules, not only the shared template guarantees.

## Guardrail violations
- No direct AI diagnosis/prescription/treatment wording violation found; guardrail gaps are mostly missing specificity, not prohibited behavior.
- Minimal integration guardrail is respected at a high level.
- Access control and auditability are acknowledged but need explicit lifecycle and event detail before implementation.
- Analytics should use de-identified identifiers and must not include raw patient text, document contents, or extracted clinical values.

## Patch suggestions
### Patch 1
```md
Add to FR2: Period filtering must support the MVP-approved presets or custom start/end dates, apply inclusive date boundaries, and use result date when present with upload date as a visibly labeled fallback. Invalid ranges keep the previous valid filter and show validation copy. No matching records shows a non-destructive no-results state with clear/reset actions.
```

### Patch 2
```md
Add to Product guardrails / Functional requirements: Access grants must be resolved before rendering sensitive fields. Define allowed actors for this surface, grant source, expiration/revocation behavior, and blocked-access result. Audit sensitive actions with actor_id, actor_type, patient/preparation_case id, object id, action, result, timestamp, and surface; do not include raw clinical text in analytics payloads.
```

### Patch 3
```md
Add to Suggested analytics events / DoD: Replace the generic primary_action event with a feature-specific event name and properties for result_state, reason_code, object/status count, and source surface. Extend DoD so QA verifies the feature-specific state model, blocked access, audit event emission for sensitive views/mutations, and no leakage of original document or patient-entered content into analytics.
```

## Final recommendation
- Ready after fixes
- Next best action: Apply the targeted patches above to the source spec before handing it to Claude Code for implementation.
- Owner: Product for unresolved workflow/access decisions; engineering for implementation mapping, tests, audit, and analytics wiring.
